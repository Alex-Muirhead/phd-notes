## Notes

Doesn't appear to use a **coupled** radiation model / weak coupling
Radiation is dominated by CO2 bands in the midwave infrared
Tangent slab shown to be overly conservative (in excess) by as much as 58%
  - This appears to be for the backbody, rather than frontbody
  - Complex wake-flows mean the tangent slab isn't always an upper limit

Details on HARA (NEQAIR alternative)
  - Line-by-line approach used for *atoms* and *optically thick molecules*
  - Smeared rotation band approach used for *optically thin molecules*

NEQAIR allows for reduced database by _pseudo-continuum_ approach
Shows the assymmetric distribution of radiant intensity at various points 
on the capsule. 
  - Highlights how the tangent slab assumption doesn't apply well to these points. 
  - Only applies well (within 10%) to the stagnation line and aft-centerline

## Takeaways

Required full angular integration resolution of ~1100 points
Radiance takes a **long** distance to drop to zero in the wake! ~20m
