## Notes

Simulation is still coupled through tangent slab method between HARA and LAURA
Ray-tracing is done as a post-procesing step on surface-points
Goes into detail about the methods of ray-tracing and interpolation of cell data
Restricted to hex structured grids
Simulation configuration (FireII aeroshell):
  - Trajectory point at time 1636s
  - $u = 11.3km/s$
  - rho = 8.57E-05 kg/m3
  - T = 210K
  - 11 species air mix (mostly Nitrogen and Oxygen w/ electrons)
